# KRED: Considerations over Attention and Embeddings

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Digital news are arguably ones of the most consumed products by millions of people every day 
and the importance of a proper recommendation system has always been fundamental for news and press websites.
KRED deals with a knowledge graph system, taking in account information from entityâ€™s neighborhood, and refines the
entity embedding with dynamic insights depending on the context of the news.
This repository proposes two main improvements to the original model: a Multi-Head Attention module 
and an enrichment of side information encodings, such as category. 
The dataset used is MIND dataset, created on a huge amount of Microsoft News interactions between users and news.

## Description
KRED is a knowledge enhanced framework which enhance a document embedding with knowledge information for multiple news recommendation tasks. 
The framework mainly contains two part: representation enhancement part and multi-task training part.

Two extensions to this model have been implemented:
1. in the context embedding layer, we enriched the entity emdedding with the news category, consisting of a first general category and a second more specific category
2. in the information distillation layer, we replaced the self-attention module with a multi-head attention module

The backbone resources of this project are listed in this table, including papers and corresponding GitHub repos.

## Setup

### Requirements
1. The project has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04), MacOS and Windows (10)
2. Python 3.8+ version is needed
3. Multiple NVIDIA GPU are mandatory to run the model in feasible time but, if the dataset is undersampled, the number of GPUs needed can be reduced; we could run the model with Colab's GPU (Tesla T4 16GB), after sampling properly MIND

### Enviroment
Once the repo is cloned, some python libraries are required to properly setup your (virtual) enviroment.


They can be installed via pip:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or via conda:
```bash
    conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```

### Dataset and Features
The dataset explored by KRED is MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND), a large-scale dataset collected by anonymized behavior logs of Microsoft News website. 
Constructed from the user click logs, MIND contains 1 million users and more than 160k English news articles; 
in addition, Microsoft has released a smaller version of the original dataset, by randomly sampling 50k users and their behavior logs.

After preprocessing the dataset with BERT, each Document Vector should be structured in:
- News ID
- Category and Sub-Category
- Title and a brief Abstract
- URL of the news
- List of entities in the Title
- List of entities in the Abstract

In turn, each entity should be characterized by:
- Label, which the entity is associated to
- Type of entity, such as person, object ecc.
- WikidataId of the label
- Confidence of label
- Position of first char in the text
- Entity itself

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting started
Before running the code, you should check `config.yaml` and setup all the parameters correctly; 
once done, you can perfom the training and testing phases in `main.py`.

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in `kred_example.ipynb` for a guided experience.
